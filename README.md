  ### Real Person: 
  
  Alejandra, is a mother of two, 31 years old who lives in Tegucigalpa, the capital city of Honduras. She works as office cleaner. Her husband work in construction. During the pandemic, both lost their jobs and have had difficulties to feed their family. Honduras, an underdeveloped country doesn’t have the resources to feed the whole country. This has been in lockdown since March and citizens can only leave their home once every 10 days. Some essential workers can go out, but they can’t because offices are closed, and construction work has been stopped. She has been struggling to feed her family and provide the basic needs. Food is one of the major issues due to the lack of job, money and they have to rely on some government assistance,  when it is possible, or non-profit such as churches or organizations that distribute food from time to time. Sometimes, they have to violate the lockdown to go out and look for groceries, or try to gain some money with temp jobs.
